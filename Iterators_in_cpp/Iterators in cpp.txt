libraries in cpp:
------------------------

using name space std, cout, cin all will be in <iostream> library in cpp
printf , will be in <stdio.h>


STL Introduction:
=================
STL is usually divided into two parts 1. containers, 2.algorithms

containers are like usually data structures which can be implemented using this.

containers are again divided into three types:
a. simple: pair, vector, forward list, list
b. simple containers: stack, queue, priority queue
c. Assosiative: set,map, unordered-set, unordered-map

set means singlekey items where as map means collection of key vaue pairs.


Iterators in c++ STL:
====================
Iterators basically used in both containers and algorithms.

It helps to give address of the elements in the containers.
